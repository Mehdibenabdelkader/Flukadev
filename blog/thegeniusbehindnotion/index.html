I mean, after all, time is money, and who wouldn’t want a system to save currency? Therefore, I’ve been on the hunt for a note-taking system that caters to my needs without being cumbersome to access or maintain, or overall too complicated. Now, some might already know that I’m a big fan of Obsidian—it’s my note-taking app of choice—but that’s not the focus here. Through my research, I stumbled upon Notion, and I’m pretty sure you’ve heard of it too.\nNotion is a freemium productivity and note-taking web application developed by Notion Labs Inc. It offers, and I quote, “organizational tools including task management, project tracking, to-do lists, and bookmarking.”\nNow, what exactly makes Notion so intriguing that I felt compelled to dedicate a post to it? When the founders at Notion were developing this app, they tossed out all the principles of building a startup, with the main rule they broke being: focus on one niche. Notion is the opposite of that. Need a note-taking app? We’ve got you covered. Todo list? Done. Team and project management? Say no more… and they did it seamlessly, effectively competing with various apps and generating a business valued at billions of dollars.\nWhat’s even more fascinating about this concept is that Notion didn’t provide all these services in the best possible way. On the contrary, it lacked many features compared to its competitors: you can’t modify fonts, and you’re limited to just 10 colors to choose from. They deconstructed other apps to distill a general solution simple enough to be released as a Version 1.0.\nNow, here’s the tricky part—why people are so obsessed with this software, and why I initially hesitated to adopt it. A bit of research helped me discover that Notion is based on psychological effects, with the most significant one being the Ikea effect, which states that people attribute disproportionately higher value to things they built themselves. And this is precisely what happens when you first delve into Notion. You spend hours crafting templates and constructing the ultimate system to track your todos, notes, and nearly every aspect of your life. As a result, you attach more value to it compared to a regular todo app. Yes, this app might have some cool features, but it’s not truly yours.\nThe paradox of Notion is that you end up spending more time building and tweaking the system that’s supposed to make you productive, rather than actually being productive. And this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Notion provides a piece of software so flexible and enjoyable to use that spending time tinkering with it brings a sense of fulfillment. But that’s something only a Notion user can truly understand.\nSo, what do you think? Is Notion the ultimate tool for you?\n",
