      <description>Well good news, I started working on actual real world porjects (gotta leave the tutorial hell at some point), I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to share those as soon as possible. I got the chance to ask many people, explore many projects and gather valuable information that I am eager to implement. But today I want to talk about one thing that we can find in every project repository, an element that could make or break the developer&amp;rsquo;s experience, yet very underrated and often overlooked : A &amp;ldquo;Readme.</description>

      <title>The art of orchestrating containers</title>

      <description>Introduction: Setting the Stage Imagine an orchestra preparing for a grand performance. Each musician, with their unique instrument, needs to play in harmony to create a masterpiece. Now, picture this scene without a conductor. Every musician is freestyling, obviously playing out of sync, resulting in a thunderstorm.
Now let&amp;rsquo;s imagine that this orchestra is our app, each service (inside a container ofc) is a musician trying to contribute to the symphony of delivering a product, in this case we need a maestro to put the cherry on top and deliver art to our end user.</description>

      <title>Book Review : Build Your Second Brain</title>

      <description>I decided to take a break from learn the technicalities and take a look at the systems and tools I set in place to make my journey easier, after all Abraham Lincoln was quoted as saying :
“ Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the ax. ”
Under the light of this idea I decided to read a book (Very Big deal, I rarely read), &amp;ldquo;Building a Second Brain&amp;rdquo; is a book by Tiago Forte that explores the concept of creating a digital system to augment your thinking and productivity.</description>

      <title>Today I learned : Containers</title>

      <description>Another day, and another buzzword to learn. As I am learning more and more about new concepts I find out that some topics I used to think are impossible to grasp - because of confusing they can be - are pretty simple (even fun sometimes) when you put you&amp;rsquo;re mind to it and approach it the right way, Today&amp;rsquo;s topic will be all about containers. First I thought this was just a funny comparaison that people used to explain how to deliver software, but turns out it&amp;rsquo;s actually a thing : the same way a we ship goodies from a country to a country, we can ship software (the computer goodies) from a computer to another.</description>

      <title>Load Balancing : A piece of cake</title>

      <description>if modern infrastructure design was a birthday party, Load balancing would be sharing a cake, and you can&amp;rsquo;t have a party without cake ofc (I am sorry I can&amp;rsquo;t help it I love these analogies), ensuring high availability and efficient distribution of incoming traffic across multiple servers or instances, in other words making sure that everyone gets a slice. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides two popular load balancer services: the Application Load Balancer (ALB) and the Network Load Balancer (NLB).</description>

      <title>Infrastructure as Code (IaC): A Beginner&#39;s Guide</title>

      <description>Since the day I decided to embark on the journey to discover the field of devops, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) was a buzzword I kept hearing around, a word I never understood exactly what it means, well till today. I usually just hold a conversation with someone and start to lose interest when they mention anything related to methods or tools of maintaining an infrastructure because to me that concept was a bit too far-fetched (and pretty overwhelming tbh).</description>

      <title>Today I Learned : Monolith vs Microservices</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There are only two ways to lead: you either divide and conquer, or you build and unite.&amp;rdquo;
This concept of dividing to conquer was a staple in the course of my academic life, I found it very intresting how such an idea can be applied to multiple fields of study, even in life problems. And on my journey towards becoming a better devops enginner, I learned that this concept is the base of a whole architecture, and the difference between monolithic applications and microservices.</description>

      <title>Beyond the tools: Why Understanding UI Design Theory Matters</title>
      <link>https://Mehdibenabdelkader.github.io/Flukadev/blog/uitoolsvstheory/</link>

      <description>Lately I received many questions concerning Ui design and got to speak to many people about the topic, and that&amp;rsquo;s due to User Interface (UI) design playing a pivotal role in creating engaging, user-friendly experiences across various platforms and devices. And the pattern I always notice is the temptation to dive straight into learning the latest design tools and software, neglecting the importance of understanding UI design theory which can be a more strategic and enduring approach.</description>
