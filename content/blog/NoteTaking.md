I decided to take a break from learn the technicalities and take a look at the systems and tools I set in place to make my journey easier, after all Abraham Lincoln was quoted as saying :

> “ Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the ax. ”

Under the light of this idea I decided to read a book (Very Big deal, I rarely read), **"Building a Second Brain"** is a book by Tiago Forte that explores the concept of creating a digital system to augment your thinking and productivity. The book outlines a methodology for organizing and managing information effectively to enhance creativity, problem-solving, and personal development. 

## The ultimate solution to improve your memory

"How can I improve my memory?" Ever since I was young, I've been surprised by just how terrible my memory is. And to this day, I still struggle to memorize facts. I always forget people's names, and I lose my shoes at least three times a week. Among the many experts talking about how to improve our memory online, there was one approach that seemed very unexpected and different from the others : Why not go to the extreme opposite and not try to remember anything. the idea is outsource the job and delegate remembering to intelligent machines that not only won't forget a thing, but are also just one click away.

## Note-Taking as a Foundation

The author emphasizes the significance of systematic note-taking as a foundation for externalizing thoughts and ideas. This goes beyond mere information capture; it involves creating an interconnected web of knowledge for easy access and utilization.

## Organization and Retrieval

The book introduces the PARA method for organizing information, categorizing it into Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. This framework ensures efficient organization and retrieval, making relevant data readily available when needed.

## Building Knowledge Silos

The book encourages the creation of "knowledge silos" – specialized repositories for information related to specific topics or projects. This focused approach enhances expertise and facilitates deep understanding in chosen areas.

## Productivity and Creativity

The second brain is not just about organization; it serves as a catalyst for productivity and creativity. By offloading routine tasks and leveraging interconnected information, individuals can free up mental space for more innovative thinking.

## Continuous Iteration

The methodology presented in the book is not static; it encourages continuous iteration and refinement. As knowledge and needs evolve, so should your second brain system.


## Getting Your Life on Track

Now that we understand the principles of active externalism and the importance of note-taking, let's explore how to integrate these concepts into our daily lives:

1. **Choose Your Tools Wisely:**
   - Experiment with different note-taking tools, whether it's a physical notebook, a digital app, or a combination of both. Find what works best for you in different contexts, In my case I just started using Obsidian, and I am loving it (might make a guide about it soon). 

2. **Capture Ideas Immediately:**
   - When inspiration strikes or you encounter valuable information, capture it promptly. Externalizing your thoughts in real-time ensures that you won't lose crucial insights.

3. **Create a System:**
   - Develop a note-taking system that aligns with your workflow. Whether it's bullet points, mind maps, or a combination of various techniques, a consistent system enhances the effectiveness of your notes.

4. **Regular Review:**
   - Set aside time regularly to review and refine your notes. This process not only reinforces your memory but also allows you to identify patterns, refine your thinking, and adjust your course as needed


In essence, "Building a Second Brain" guides individuals to embrace digital tools and strategies, systematically organizing information to create a personalized knowledge management system. This optimization enhances thinking, creativity, and overall productivity in both personal and professional pursuits. That's all for today, till the next book (hopefully), Take care <3
