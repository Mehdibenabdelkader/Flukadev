# My Journey: Transitioning from UI/UX Design to DevOps Engineering

## Introduction

Life often presents us with unexpected opportunities for growth and change. It pushes you into paths you never thought you'd walk in, and my path took from being a seasoned UI/UX designer to becoming a aspiring and pationate DevOps engineer, it's a chance for bothseeking fresh challenges, exploring new horizons and pushing my limits. In this blog post, I'll share my story of why I decided to make this career switch, the surprising similarities I found between the two fields, and the hurdles I had and still have to overcome to become the best at what I do.

## Why ?

As a UI/UX designer with years of experience, I found myself at a crossroads in my career, on one hand I had a huge passion for creating aesthetic visuals and inclusive designs, but on the other I was presented with a plethora of skills to pick up from my academic cursus, and one stood out for me more than the others. I had mastered the art of creating seamless and delightful user experiences, but I yearned for something more. The allure of DevOps was undeniable for several reasons:

### 1. Broadening My Skill Set

My journey into DevOps was motivated by a desire to diversify my skill set. I wanted to move beyond just design and get a bird's eye view on the big world of developpement, as well as hands-on experience in the deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications. The idea of having, not only a small scope, but end-to-end ownership of my projects was both challenging and exhilarating.

### 2. A Passion for Problem-Solving

I am a problem-solver. finding creative solutions for my issues was always a defining feature for me in my personnal and professional life. As a UI/UX designer, I tackled creative challenges, but DevOps offered me an new set of complex and technical problems to solve. and I am ready to apply my creative problem-solving mindset to this new frontier and bring a new perspective to this field.

### 3. A Thriving Job Market

The DevOps field is in high demand, and the opportunities are endless. Companies are constantly on the lookout for skilled DevOps professionals who can streamline their processes and improve their product development cycle, and they're willing to pay big bucks for it.

## The Surprising Similarities

I was called a madman after announcing this enourmous shift, from the "visual aesthetic" world of design to the stress of testing and maintaining entire pipelines, I wasn't sure it was the right step for me either, yet I was pleasantly surprised by the similarities I found:


### 1. A User-Centric Approach

UI/UX designers are well-versed in the importance of putting the user first. DevOps, surprisingly, shares this perspective. DevOps engineers ensure applications run smoothly, providing a seamless user experience, and this user-centric approach is at the heart of both fields.

### 2. Continuous Improvement

UI/UX designers are no strangers to iteration and continuous improvement, move this element, change this color... In DevOps, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices aim to enhance software quality and delivery speed through iterative processes. This focus on continuous enhancement resonated very well with my design background.

### 3. Team work makes the dream work

Both UI/UX designers and DevOps engineers thrive on collaboration. In the world of UI/UX, we work closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders. Similarly, DevOps engineers collaborate with a variety of teams, including developers, operations, and quality assurance, to ensure a successful product launch.

### 4. Automation

Automation is a common thread that ties these fields together. UI/UX designers often leverage automation tools to streamline repetitive tasks. In DevOps, automation is a crucial piece in processes like testing, deployment, and monitoring.

### 5. Feedback-Driven

In UI/UX design, feedback from users is essential for refining designs. In the DevOps realm, feedback from monitoring and testing is used to improve the performance and reliability of applications. Both fields value feedback and the iterative nature of refinement.

## The Challenges I am facing

The guardians of the devops realm made sure that this transition wasn't easy at all, this leap came with a whole set of hurdles, some more difficult to overcome than others :

### 1. The steep Learning Curve

Even though Devops in its core is a simple set of parctices, becoming proficient in various technical tools and concepts is necessary, and it's the most significant challenge. You need to develop a deep understanding of scripting, containerization (e.g., Docker), orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), cloud platforms, and more.

### 2. Adaptability

the fast-paced and dynamic environment of developement in the devops industry also presents a challenge. You have to adapt to tight deadlines, quickly respond to issues, and follow the wave of new tools and trends while making sure you understand the basics, which is a bit of a change from the more structured pace of UI/UX design.

### 3. Security Awareness

Security is a paramount concern in DevOps, a huge mountain I never dared to climb (sike, there is a first time for everything). You need to learn security best practices and remain vigilant about potential vulnerabilities to ensure the safety of the systems you manage.


## Conclusion

My journey from UI/UX design to DevOps engineering is a transformative experience. It's a bold decision to stand by, one that will hopefully be rewarding. This transition will allow me to leverage perspective as a proficient designer and an ambitious developer and mix these qualities to leave this industry with one unique cocktail (That's me). I hope my story inspires others to embrace change and explore new career opportunities, as there's a world of possibilities waiting for those willing to take the leap.
