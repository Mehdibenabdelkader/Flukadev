As someone who draws inspiration from the real world, I find myself constantly observing life's intricacies. I'm on a quest to become a better UI/UX Designer, a more diligent student, and a more compassionate human being in general. Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending a wedding – a celebration brimming with delectable food, enchanting music, and countless lessons waiting to be learned.

## **Research is Crucial: The Surprising Fashion Fiasco**
The morning of the wedding dawned, and I was brimming with excitement, ready to unveil my carefully chosen outfit: sleek black pants paired with a crisply ironed white shirt. I had a playful idea to add a splash of color and personality with my favorite red tie, the red tie that would come to the rescue later that night. Little did I know, a fashion crisis was lurking around the corner because the food caterers "serbaya" chose to wear the same exact ensemble (minus the distinct red tie, of course).

In design, as in life, you won't always be lucky, also your users won't always be forgiving, and can catch you off guard when you least expect it – even at a wedding. It's a reminder that research is crucial to avoid unexpected pitfalls.

## **Study Your Audience: A Melting Pot of Joy**
The wedding I attended was a magnificent fusion of cultures and backgrounds. The hosts had done their homework; everything was ready. There was an array of music, from heart-pounding beats to soul-stirring melodies, to match diverse tastes. The wedding even featured a magnificent feast, with a seafood BASTILLA, succulent meats, mouthwatering chicken, sweet delicacies, and an assortment of refreshing beverages. It was an orchestra of flavors that left no one unsatisfied.

And that's why you need to focus on studying your audience, a trivial step but one that we neglect often. It's surprising how much new information you might find out if you really pour your heart into your audience and keep your design user-centered from start to finish.

This beautiful experience serves as a reminder of the importance of deeply understanding your audience, diving into their world, and keeping your design user-centered from the first draft to the final one. You'd be amazed at the gems you'll uncover when you truly connect with your users.

## **Make Your Important Elements Stand Out: Recognizing the Key Players**
Amidst the lively music and dancing, I took a breather to do some people-watching. Gotta catch up on the gossip, you know? It was like being in the heart of a colorful story. I couldn't help but notice the key players. There, at the center of it all, sat the groom and the bride (l3ris ou l3rossa), radiating warmth and joy. A bit farther away, two elegantly dressed women moved gracefully through the crowd. Their calm and composed behavior showed the wisdom of experience. These, I figured, must be the mothers. Not too far off, two sharply dressed gentlemen navigated the lively gathering with determination in their steps. Their black outfits made them stand out among the colorful attire. I guessed they were the brothers, guiding the proceedings with an air of authority. And then, in their distinctive uniforms, stood the "serbaya" and "negafat", overseeing the event with grace and dignity. Their poised presence was hard to miss. As for me, well, I had my own distinctive feature – my dashing handsomeness, which set me apart in a different way.

Recognizing these central figures amidst the joyful chaos made the experience even more enjoyable. It was clear who to approach for a water refill, where to share congratulations, and, most importantly, where to find directions to the restroom.

In this grand spectacle of the wedding, just like in a designed user interface, every detail counts, and every role is crucial. It's very important to provide the user with key elements to guide his navigation, ensuring that users never got lost nor confused while using your app.

## **The Power of a Custom Experience: Heartfelt Connections**
Amidst the whirlwind of joy, one heartwarming detail stood out to me the most. The bride and groom, the central stars of this celestial celebration, made it a point to personally greet and thank each guest. Their genuine warmth and connection added an extra layer of magic to the entire event. This simple act reminded me that, in the world of design, infusing that personal touch can make all the difference. Whether it's crafting a personalized and custom user journey or adding a heartfelt message to your interface, never underestimate the power of making your users feel genuinely valued and appreciated. After all, it's these personal touches that turn a good user experience into an unforgettable one.

## **Adapt and Evolve, Just Like the Dance Floor**
As the night unfolded, the music shifted seamlessly from traditional beats that made hips sway (OUR CHAABI OF COURSE) to slow, timeless classics that touched the soul. What was remarkable was how every guest, regardless of age or background, found their rhythm on the dance floor. It was a lesson in adaptability, a reminder that change can be embraced with open arms.

In UX, this translates to being flexible and open to change. Just as the dance floor shifted to accommodate different styles, your design should adapt to cater to evolving user preferences and technologies. Embrace new trends and technologies to keep your user experience fresh and appealing.


In conclusion, the wedding was a fantastic source of inspiration and a reminder that valuable UX insights can be found in the most unexpected places. So, keep researching, understanding your audience, and emphasizing key elements in your designs, and most importantly have fun and you'll be well on your way to creating exceptional user experiences. After all, life's celebrations, much like great design, are all about the delightful details!
